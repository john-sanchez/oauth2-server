# oauth2-server

A simple integration of Spring-boot, Spring-security, Spring-data, and a simple bootstrap UI for login. This server is an Auth server + resource server in one box.

This project has the POJOs needed for Spring-data to create the necessary tables needed by Spring's OAuth client and token detials.

# Future Goal

To be able to create a maven archetype from this.
